A comprehensive cryptographic web application built to evaluate and compare the performance, size, and security levels of classical (RSA), post-quantum (Kyber, Dilithium), and hybrid cryptographic algorithms. Developed using Python (Flask backend) and React.js frontend, this project adheres to NIST recommendations and is tailored for benchmarking in constrained environments including mobile processors and IoT devices.
